## Introduction


We built Motor UI to provide:

- <b>Easy Mashup Development</b>: We aim to make the creation of Qlik Mashups as simple as possible for developers, removing the need 
for detailed knowledge of the Qlik APIs.
- Powerful Theming: Tailor the component library to your brand and layout needs. From simply applying your 
brand color, to editing our theme object and component functionality via props.
- Responsive Experience: All components and visualisations are responsive, with variations built into our theme object. 
Make the choice how content adjust for tablet and mobile, or go with our pre-built themes.

The library simplifies Mashup development by handling connection to the engine and API interactions for you,
reducing the development time and complexity of your Mashup code.

The components require an open connection to a Qlik engine. To create this connection you'll 
need to pass your server details to the individual components, or if your using React, via our Motor parent component.
