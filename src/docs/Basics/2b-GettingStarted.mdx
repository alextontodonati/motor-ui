## Getting Started

Motor UI components are built in React and distributed cross platform as web components. As such, installation and usage does differ between React and Angular/Vue projects. 
These differences are documented on this page.

<br />

## Installation

### Install via NPM

```javascript
npm i motor-ui
```

### Include in your HTML

```javascript
<script src="...motor-ui"></script>
```

<br />

## Usage with React

We recommend you start by wrapping your React document with the Motor parent component.
This handles two things: 
- Connection to the Qlik Engine (you can pass configuration or the engine object directly)
- Theming

You can then import the React component from the package and you're good to go. 
Check out the full list of props and theming options for each component in these docs.

```javascript

import { Motor } from 'motor-ui'
import classic from 'motor-ui/themes'

<Motor 
    config={url:'ws://localhost:19077/app', app:"MyAwesomeApp.qvf"}
    theme={classic}>
...
    <Button type='export' title='Download' />
</Motor>

```

Note, you can pass the configuration to connect to the Qlik engine directly in the components, if you prefer. 
Some styling can also be applied directly to the components as props. 


```javascript

import { Button } from 'motor-ui'
 
<Button 
    config={url:'ws://localhost:19077/app', app:"MyAwesomeApp.qvf"}
    type='export' 
    title='Download' 
    backgroundColor='var(--oc-red-6)'
/>

```

<br />

## Usage with Web components

With web components, there is no parent component, so you need to pass the config directly to your individual components.
We also have a limitation wih Set Analysis, specifically the characters "<" and ">" cannot be passed in the components. You can check out more on that here.

If you're not familiar with web components, these resources can help get you started...

Note that objects are passed in JSON format, you can notice the difference in the config setup, in example below.

Import the package and use the component.

```javascript

import 'motor-ui/web';
 
<motor-button
    config='{"url":"ws://localhost:19077/app", "app":"MyAwesomeApp.qvf"}'
    type="export" 
    title="Download" 
    backgroundColor='var(--oc-red-6)'>
</motor-button>

```
