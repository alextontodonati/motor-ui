## Theming with React

A big part of Motor UI is its theming framework. There are a lot of things you can customize. This page aims to explain it all.

If you're working in React, the recommended path to creating a new theme, is to pass it to the Motor component.

```javascript

import { Motor } from 'motor-ui';

const myTheme = {
  global: {
    colors: {
      brand: 'red',
    },
  },
};

<Motor value={myTheme}>
  ...
</Motor>

```

This is just an example of using the theme to replace the app's brand color. There are a couple of things you should know:

There is a base theme and the customizations you add will merge with it if you use the deepMerge function. As a result, you only need to pass what you need to change, not the entire theme object. These changes will only affect the children of the Theme component.

## Structure

The structure of the JSON object is divided into two parts: global and each component entry, for example:

```javascript

const myTheme = {
  global: {
    // changes here will affect more than one component at a time
  },
  filter: {
    // changes here will affect the Filter component only
  },
  ...
}

```

## API

This section documents each of the theme entries so that you know what is possible to customize in each component. 
For simplicity sake, we will reduce the JSON notation to dot signs, so global.animation.duration will translate to:
